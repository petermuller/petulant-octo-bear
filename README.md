==================

A personal programming challenge.

This program will display the Nth prime number, which is specified by the user.
Since this uses a brute-force method for calculating prime numbers, large values of N will have longer loading times.

Dependencies
------------
Python 2.7.3
python-tkinter

Instructions
------------
To use this program, enter a positive whole number where this number will be the Nth prime number. 
Large numbers will take some time to calculate, but once it is calculated, it and the numbers before it will not need to be calculated again in that session. 
To use CLI mode, run the command 'python main.py -c'. This will allow the user to enter a number, get the result, and then either exit or continue entering numbers. 
To use the GUI, run the program without any arguments. This will allow the user to enter numbers or exit at the push of the button.
