==================

A personal programming challenge.

This program will display some prime number operations. The Nth prime number can be found or it can be determined if a number is prime or not.

Since this uses a brute-force method for calculating prime numbers, large values will have longer loading times. 
However, once a prime number is calculated, it is stored and will not have to be calculated again.

Prerequisites
-------------
Python 2.7.x

python-tkinter

Instructions
------------
To use this program, enter positive integers when prompted to check what the Nth prime number is, or if a number is prime or not.

Large numbers will take some time to calculate, but once it is calculated, it and the numbers before it will not need to be calculated again in that session.

To use CLI mode, run the command 'python main.py -c'. This will allow the user to enter a number, get the result, and then either exit or continue entering numbers.

To use the GUI, run the program without any arguments. This will allow the user to enter numbers or exit at the push of the button.
